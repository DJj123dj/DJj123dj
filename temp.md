# Hi, I'm DJj123dj!
I'm a 15 year old student in Belgium who is facinated by everything related to programming!

### About me
My real name is Jasper. I live in üáßüá™ Belgium and I can speak Dutch, English and a very little bit of French.
My hobbies are:
- üñ•Ô∏è Programming
- üéß DJ (and event lightning)
- üèÄ Basketball

I learned programming when I was 10 years old (using Scratch).
Then I continued writing Applescript for over 2 years. But my first **real programming language* was node.js in 2019. I learned it by writing discord bots using discord.js. Eventually, I started creating sideprojects that became large projects. With these projects, I learned working with new languages like python, lua & java!

I also started combining programming with my other hobbies, like DJ‚Äôing. This year (2023), I made my very own lightning control software that makes use of virtual midi drivers, electron, tailwindcss & DMX to control all the lights live on the stage!

## DJdj Development

In 2019, I founded the (sort of) company DJdj Development.
It's a group of developers who create interesting projects together!
Our main goal is to create qualitative open-source projects for everyone!


Our first project was Open Ticket, a popular open-source ticket bot! Then we also created 2 discord bots that everyone can host! One for minecraft, the other one for a calculator! Check out all our projects on our website!

## GitHub Gists
### [Advanced String to Number Converter (Javascript)](https://gist.github.com/DJj123dj/39a4daf6cb68d4d14be20466a64ce2a7)
This is an Advanced String to Number converter! It can convert things like this:</br>
`123.345.234,2` (String) to `123345234.2` (Number)</br>
The cool part is that it automatically detects the decimal point, so you can put lots of dots or commas between the string.

### [Discord.js 14 Start File (Node.js)](https://gist.github.com/DJj123dj/ab232f20ee22ff5e05e06426ecd6ed77)
This is a file that you can use to rapidly create a new discord bot in djs 14.</br>
It includes all the code needed to create a discord.js Client.
