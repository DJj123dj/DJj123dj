# Hi there, I'm DJj123dj üòé
I'm a 16 year old student from Belgium and I create projects and stuff that actually works! Programming is my primary hobby and my dream is to make it my job.

### Bio
My first interaction with programming started using **Swift Playground** when I was 10 years old. But the real trigger was **AppleScript** a few months later. This allowed me to automate stuff on my computer and write "fake" virusses for my computer. Around 2 years later I discovered **Discord Bots** and started creating them using BotGhost. This was very limited and I quickly switched to creating custom bots using **discord.js**. This was also the time I learned my first *real programming language* node.js.

From 2019-2022 I made more than **40+ custom Discord Bots** for many servers. One of these custom bots was a ticket bot that I open-sourced a while later. This was the birth of **Open Ticket**, which is currently known as most advanced & customisable open-source Discord Ticket Bot. It's story is quite interesting because it became **popular on accident**. In the early days of Open Ticket it wasn't even that customisable at all and had lots of bugs and issues, but I still proceeded to work on it. Eventually it grew and got more features which results in the ticket bot you know and love today. Since 2023 I also started working on making sideprojects like **Math Master** the calculator bot, **Discord Alt Detector**, **Formatted JSON Stringify**, **LiveControl** the Lightning Control Software for DJ's and more! By creating these sideprojects I learned lots of new languages like PHP, typescript, CSS, Lua, Python and more!

This year (2025) I'm developing and contributing to large projects like the major **Open Ticket v4** update, **LiveControl v2** and **TeamPlayer** a sportclub management system. Ofcourse I'm still working on other smaller projects, experiments and tools. My plans for 2026 are working on Open Ticket updates & plugins, fixing the documentation, continuing to develop **LiveControl v2** and **TeamPlayer** and possibly some extra npm packages. My goal for the future is to create **Open Moderation** at some point which is a Discord moderation bot with the same amount of customisability & flexibility as Open Ticket.

This is an Advanced String to Number converter! It can convert things like this:</br>
`123.345.234,2` (String) to `123345234.2` (Number)</br>
The cool part is that it automatically detects the decimal point, so you can put lots of dots or commas between the string.
