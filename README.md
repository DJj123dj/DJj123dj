# Hello, I'm DJj123dj
## Who am I?
My first name is Jasper. I'm almost 14 years old and I live in Belgium.
I'm usually happy and I love programming!

## My experience
I once started writing simple scripts in the language "applescript" when I was 9 years old. Then I liked programming so much that I chose multiple languages. I've started programming Swift, but I'm not quite done with it yet.


2 years ago I started with node.js after I already knew a basic course HTML, CSS & Javascript.
I stayed on node.js for a long time and now I'm still working with it.


At some point, I also liked adding something graphic to it and focusing more on games. So I started making python apps and minecraft mods. I also made a roblox app once. Because I'm good at lua too. Now I'm making my own OS for ComputerCraft!

### You can ask me for:
- node.js apps
