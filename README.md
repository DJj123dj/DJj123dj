# Hello, I'm DJj123dj
My name is Jasper. I'm 14 years old and I live in Belgium.
Most people know me as DJj123dj or just dj :)

I started programming when I was 9, and I still love it to this day.
I'm someone that loves to discover new things, thats why I have a wide range of things that I can do.

I'm the owner of DJdj Development, a starting group of developers. We make a lot of cool stuff!

## My experience
I started with writing applescript, but I wanted more! So I started with other languages.
I discovered <img src="https://www.dj-dj.be/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/clyde.png" width="20px"> mid 2021. When I saw the first discord bot, I wanted to create them too. And thats where the journey started.

  ### My Story (detailed)
  
  I started writing simple scripts in the language "applescript" when I was 9 years old (2017). I was getting addicted to programming so much that I wanted to program 24/7. It was just the feeling of "I can create anything I want!" My second language I started with was Swift from Apple. I can write the basics now, but i'm not finished yet.

  In early 2021, I started with node.js when I discovered Discord. By creating discord bots & experimenting with the language. I slowly got to know Javascript, HTML & CSS. I'm still working with node.js today! It's my favourite language!

  In the summer of 2022 did I notice a problem... I could only do backend! So I started discovering a lot of graphical languages. I started with Tailwind CSS & HTML websites, I also made a roblox app once.
  
  In late 2022, app development was on the planning. I started with creating apps & games, In Electron, Godot & Unity. I also learned Python & PHP :)
